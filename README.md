# AI-Project-Framework
AI project framework, informed by Gitlab Maturity

## Workflow
Workflow is a combination of github issues, tags, project, and built-in automation. This workflow is setup for Github, but the framework could be replicated in other systems. I like github because it keeps the data scientists working and planning in the same environment. 


### Issue Templates
There are two issues types available. Tasks are actions that add function to the AI project. Bugs are problems found with the AI project.
- Task: Task relating to an AI project
- Bug: Bug with the AI project

Each issue is made up of 5 components:
- Title: Unique and descriptive title
- Content: Details of the task or bug
- Tags: Add the stage(s) associated with the issue
- Project: AI project kanban board of the AI team
- Milestone: Bucket of work based to enable the prioritization
